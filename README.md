# Gene expression units and calculations


**RPM or CPM (Reads per million mapped reads or Counts per million mapped reads)**

Counts per million (CPM) is a normalization method commonly used in genomics and transcriptomics to account for differences in sequencing depth or library size when comparing gene expression levels across samples.

Here's how CPM is calculated:

1. **Total Counts**: First, calculate the total number of sequencing reads (or counts) for each sample. This represents the library size or sequencing depth of each sample.

2. **Normalization**: Divide the count of each gene by the total count for the corresponding sample.

3. **Scaling**: Multiply the result by a million to scale the counts to a common reference point, allowing for comparison between samples.

The formula for calculating CPM for a specific gene  $\( g \)$ in a sample $\( i \)$ is:  $\[ CPM_{gi} = \frac{{Counts_{gi}}}{{Total\_Counts_i}} \times 10^6 \]$
                               

Where:
- $\( CPM_{gi} \)$ is the counts per million for gene $\( g \)$ in sample $\( i \)$.
- $\( Counts_{gi} \)$ is the count of gene \( g \) in sample $\( i \)$.
- $\( Total\_Counts_i \)$ is the total count of all genes in sample $\( i \)$.

Counts per million normalization allows for the comparison of gene expression levels between samples, accounting for differences in sequencing depth or library size. This normalization method is particularly useful in RNA-seq experiments, where the number of reads mapped to each gene can vary significantly between samples due to technical factors or biological variability.


**RPKM (Reads per kilo base of transcript per million mapped reads)**

RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) is a normalization method used in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis to measure gene expression levels. It accounts for both the length of the transcripts and the sequencing depth. Hereâ€™s an overview of what RPKM is and how it is calculated:

### Understanding RPKM

**RPKM** is designed to compare the expression levels of genes within a single sample by normalizing for:
1. **Transcript length**: Longer transcripts are more likely to have more reads simply because they are longer.
2. **Sequencing depth**: This ensures that differences in the number of reads across samples do not affect the comparison of gene expression levels.

### Calculation of RPKM

The formula to calculate RPKM for a given gene is: $\[ \text{RPKM} = \frac{\text{Number of reads mapping to the gene}}{\left(\frac{\text{Total reads in the sample}}{1,000,000}\right) \times \left(\frac{\text{Length of the gene in base pairs}}{1,000}\right)} \] $

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Number of Reads Mapping to the Gene**: Count the number of reads that map to the specific gene.
2. **Total Reads in the Sample**: Calculate the total number of reads obtained from the sequencing experiment.
3. **Length of the Gene**: Determine the length of the gene (transcript) in base pairs.

### Step-by-Step Example

Assume we have:
- **1000 reads** mapping to a gene.
- **20 million total reads** in the sample.
- **2000 base pairs** (bp) length of the gene.

The calculation would be as follows:

1. **Calculate reads per million (RPM)**:
   \[ \text{RPM} = \frac{\text{Total number of reads}}{1,000,000} \]
   \[ \text{RPM} = \frac{20,000,000}{1,000,000} = 20 \]

2. **Normalize for the length of the gene**: $\[ \text{RPKM} = \frac{\text{Number of reads mapping to the gene}}{\text{RPM} \times \left(\frac{\text{Length of the gene}}{1,000}\right)} \]$
   
    $\[ \text{RPKM} =  \frac{1000}{20 \times 2} = \frac{1000}{40} = 25 \]$

Thus, the RPKM for this gene is 25.

### Key Points

- **Normalization**: RPKM accounts for sequencing depth and gene length, enabling comparison of gene expression levels within a sample.
- **Application**: Useful for identifying highly expressed genes, comparing expression levels within a sample, and detecting differential expression.
- **Limitations**: Not suitable for comparing gene expression across different samples or conditions without further normalization, as it doesn't account for differences in library composition or sequencing biases.
